Seattle Airbnb Project
Business Understanding
The datasets given are the following, calendar, listings and reviews. Just visually, the listing price seems to change drastically based on rental size, location and season. After each rental, customers leave reviews of their stay.

Questions
The questions we will be looking to answer in this project are the following:

1)How do seasonal patterns affect rental rates and occupancy?

2)How do features correlate with rental rates?

3)How does occupancy raqte over time?

Conclusions:

1) The seasonal patterns affect the rate in seattle as one might expect. In the winter months when it starts to get colder prices go down a good amount but they tend to rise when the summer months come whcih would make sense as people are finally out and about and more likeley to travel to seattle.
2) The features that most correlated with rental rate was sq ft, bedrooms (number), and bathrooms. This makes sense as bigger houses leeds to higher prices. Although location also had some coreelation.
3) Occupancy rate tended to go down quite a bit, the reason is unknow but a hypothesis is that in 2016 was the boom and a lot of houses started renting. It may be that more houses were listed so demand stayed somewaht consistent and supply did not. This would be worth reinvestigating.
