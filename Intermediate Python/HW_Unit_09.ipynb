    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will be reading and writing data. Yes, finally some data science (or at least some exploratory data analysis)! In the week_10 assignment folder, there are three data files named: \n",
    "\n",
    "* data.csv\n",
    "* data.json\n",
    "* data.pkl\n",
    "\n",
    "These are three common file formats. You can run the following **on the bash command line** to see what is in each file (this will not work from a Windows prompt but will work in git bash):\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "head data.csv\n",
    "head data.pkl\n",
    "head data.json\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll see that there is some method to the madness but that each file format has its peculiarities. Each file contains a portion of the total dataset that altogether comprises 100 records, so you need to **read in all of the files and combine them into some standard format** with which you are comfortable. Aim for something standard where each \"row\" is represented in the same format. **Name this object that contains the data for all three files combined ```full_data```**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions to answer (75 points: each question is worth 15 points):\n",
    "After you've standardized all of the data, report the following information: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. What are the unique countries in the dataset, sorted alphabetically?  Write to a new file called question_1.csv.\n",
    "2. What are the unique complete email domains in the dataset, sorted alphabetically?  Write to a new file called question_2.csv. \n",
    "3. What are the first names of everyone (including duplicates) that do not have a P.O. Box address, sorted alphabetically?  Write to a new file called question_3.csv.\n",
    "4. What are the full names of the first 5 people when you sort the data alphabetically by country?  Write to a new file called question_4.csv.\n",
    "5. What are the full names of the first 5 people when you sort the data numerically ascending by phone number?  Write to a new file called question_5.csv.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using a script to examine and grade your .csv files so please make sure: \n",
    "- The answers are all in one **column** with one list item per cell, sorted as stated in the question. I.e., looking at the .csv in a spreadsheet editor like Google Sheets, all answers would be in the 'A' column, with the first entry in A1, the second in A2, etc.\n",
    "- Please do not include a header; just the answers to the questions.\n",
    "- It is strongly recommended that you open each .csv file to ensure the answers are there and displayed correctly! \n",
    "- Don't include quotes around the list items.  I.e., strip the leading and trailing quotes, if necessary, from items when you write to the .csv files.  For example, a list entry should look like ```Spain``` rather than ```\"Spain\"```. One exception: Some country names do contain commas and it is ok to have quotes: ```\"\"``` around just those country names so that they will be in one cell in the .csv. \n",
