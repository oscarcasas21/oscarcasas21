# GCP: Query Project

- In the Query Project, we will practice with SQL while learning about
  Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and BiqQuery. We'll answer business-driven
  questions using public datasets housed in GCP.We will use the web UI (BiqQuery) and
  the command-line tools, and work with them in Jupyter Notebooks.

#### Problem Statement

- we're data scientists at Lyft Bay Wheels (https://www.lyft.com/bikes/bay-wheels), formerly known as Ford GoBike, the
  company running Bay Area Bikeshare. We are trying to increase ridership, and
  you want to offer deals through the mobile app to do so. 
  
- What deals do you offer though? Currently, our company has several options which can change over time.  Please visit the website to see the current offers and other marketing information. Frequent offers include: 
  * Single Ride 
  * Monthly Membership
  * Annual Membership
  * Bike Share for All
  * Access Pass
  * Corporate Membership
  * etc.

- Through this project, you will answer try to answer what offers are best to offer and why, however, the majority of this project is the actual construction of the tools not the actual analysis.
